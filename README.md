play around with grid beam

## what is grid beam?

grid beam is modular construction with "beams" and "grids"

each beam has the same width on the two short sides

for example, in the Imperial system, a grid beam is 1.5 inches x 1.5 inches wide.

(?) in the metric system, a grid beam is 40mm x 40mm wide.

this square is extruded on the long side at any length that is a multiple of the width.

on each pole's short sides, there are grid holes separated by the width distance.

the first grid hole starts at 1/2 of the width distance, so a compatible beam can be cut in half and still be compatible.
